Data Visualization Project: Maji Ndogo Water Crisis Analysis
Project Overview
This phase transforms the comprehensive SQL analysis into interactive visualizations using Power BI to communicate findings to stakeholders and uncover new insights about gender dynamics in water access.

New Data Integration
AI-Enhanced Queue Analysis:

Field surveyors captured photographs of water queues during site visits

Machine learning algorithms analyzed images to identify and classify individuals

New dataset includes gender and age composition percentages for each queue

Key columns added: percent_male, percent_female, percent_child, hour_of_day, day_of_week

Visualization Objectives
National-Level Dashboard:

Urban vs. rural population distribution using pie charts

Water source type breakdown with bar charts

Interactive filtering between visualizations

Total population served: ~28 million citizens

Geographical Analysis:

Custom map visualization of Maji Ndogo provinces

Provincial breakdown of infrastructure issues

Priority area identification for interventions

Interactive province selection for detailed filtering

Queue Time Analysis:

Daily and hourly queue pattern visualization

Gender composition analysis across different times

Relationship between queue length and population served

Weekend vs. weekday comparison insights

Technical Implementation
Power BI Features Utilized:

Custom JSON map integration for geographical visualization

Shape maps with background image overlays

Advanced filtering and cross-visual highlighting

Multiple chart types: pie, bar, line, scatter, and clustered bar charts

Interactive dashboard design with drill-down capabilities

Key Technical Considerations:

Data type validation for percentage columns

Visit count filtering to prevent duplicate records

Custom map configuration for unfamiliar regions

Layout optimization for clarity and impact

Critical Insights Revealed
Gender Disparity Findings:

Women bear primary responsibility for water collection during weekdays

Men's participation increases significantly on weekends

Children frequently accompany mothers, affecting education and safety

Early morning and evening queues pose safety risks for women

Queue Pattern Analysis:

Saturdays show dramatically longer queue times (246 min average vs. 82-137 min weekdays)

Morning and evening peaks align with work schedules on weekdays

More consistent queuing patterns throughout weekend days

Nonlinear relationship between queue times and population served

Infrastructure Priority Mapping:

Amanzi province identified as highest priority for infrastructure repairs

Kilimani follows as secondary focus area

Custom maps enable intuitive geographical analysis

Advanced Analytical Features
Interactive Exploration:

Cross-filtering between national and provincial views

Time-based analysis with hour-by-hour breakdowns

Gender composition trends across different days and locations

Correlation analysis between queue times and crime data (future phase)

Data Quality Validation:

Visualization revealed previously unnoticed data anomalies

Enabled identification of reporting errors through visual patterns

Provided intuitive data validation through graphical representation

Project Significance
This visualization phase demonstrates how raw data transforms into actionable insights through:

Intuitive graphical representation of complex relationships

Interactive exploration capabilities beyond static reports

Gender-based analysis revealing social dynamics

Geographical prioritization for resource allocation

Stakeholder-friendly communication of technical findings

The project showcases the power of data visualization in making complex water crisis data accessible to decision-makers and highlighting critical social equity issues.
