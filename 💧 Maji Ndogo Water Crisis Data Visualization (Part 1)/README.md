📝 Short Description

This phase transforms the Maji Ndogo water crisis SQL analysis into interactive Power BI dashboards, revealing new insights about gender roles, infrastructure priorities, and queue patterns. It builds on the cleaned database from Parts 1–4 and makes findings accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

🎯 Project Overview

Goal: Convert raw SQL findings into visual, stakeholder-friendly insights.

Scope: Interactive dashboards for national, provincial, and community-level analysis.

Dataset: Extended survey database with AI-enhanced queue composition (gender & age percentages).

🔧 Key Visualizations
🌍 National-Level Dashboard

Urban vs. rural population distribution (Pie)

Water source type breakdown (Bar)

Cross-filtering between all visuals

Total population served: ~28M citizens

🗺 Geographical Analysis

Custom Maji Ndogo province map (JSON integration)

Infrastructure issues by province & town

Interactive province selection for drill-down insights

⏱ Queue Time Analysis

Daily & hourly queue trends

Gender composition analysis (male, female, children)

Weekend vs. weekday comparison

Relationship between queue time and population served

⚙️ Technical Implementation

Power BI Features:

Custom maps with JSON & shape overlays

Cross-filtering & drill-down interactivity

Pie, bar, line, scatter, and clustered visuals

Data Preparation:

Validated percentage fields (percent_male, percent_female, percent_child)

Deduplicated visit counts to ensure accuracy

Configured regional maps for unfamiliar geographies

📈 Critical Insights

Gender Roles: Women dominate weekday water collection; men participate more on weekends.

Children’s Burden: Children frequently accompany mothers, affecting education & safety.

Queue Dynamics: Saturdays = worst wait times (246 min avg vs 82–137 weekdays).

Regional Priorities:

Amanzi Province = urgent repairs needed

Kilimani = secondary priority

🚀 Skills Showcased

Power BI Mastery: Maps, advanced filtering, and dashboard design

SQL + BI Integration: Seamless transition from database to visualization

Data Storytelling: Turning complex data into clear narratives

Social Impact Analysis: Gender equity, safety, and regional disparities
